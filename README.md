🛡️ AetherNet Phishing Awareness Simulation

An interactive phishing awareness training simulation built using Ren’Py.

This project places the player in the role of a Security Analyst reviewing corporate emails. Through branching decisions, users identify phishing attempts, analyze psychological manipulation tactics, and assess organizational risk.

🎯 Objective

To educate users about real-world phishing strategies using gamified, decision-based scenarios.

Players must:

Analyze incoming emails
